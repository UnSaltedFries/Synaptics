        "faq.q2": "What happens if the AI can't answer a question?",
        "faq.a2": "The AI gracefully escalates to a human. It can transfer the call, take a detailed message, or schedule a callback — depending on your preference. You're always in control.",
        "faq.q3": "How long does setup take?",
        "faq.a3": "Most agents are deployed within 48-72 hours. Complex integrations with CRM systems or custom workflows may take 1-2 weeks. We handle everything — you just approve the voice and script.",
        "faq.q4": "Can callers tell they're speaking to an AI?",
        "faq.a4": "Our voices are built with cutting-edge synthesis technology. Most callers don't realize they're speaking to an AI. We prioritize natural conversation flow, appropriate pauses, and human-like intonation.",
        "faq.q5": "What integrations do you support?",
        "faq.a5": "We integrate with Google Calendar, Doctolib, HubSpot, Salesforce, and most CRM/booking systems via API. We also connect through Zapier, Make, and n8n for custom workflows.",
        "faq.q6": "Is my data secure?",
        "faq.a6": "Absolutely. All calls are encrypted, and we comply with GDPR. Call recordings are stored securely and can be auto-deleted based on your retention policy. We never sell or share your data.",

        "faq.q2": "Que se passe-t-il si l'IA ne peut pas répondre à une question ?",
        "faq.a2": "L'IA transfère élégamment à un humain. Elle peut transférer l'appel, prendre un message détaillé ou planifier un rappel — selon vos préférences. Vous gardez toujours le contrôle.",
        "faq.q3": "Combien de temps prend l'installation ?",
        "faq.a3": "La plupart des agents sont déployés sous 48-72h. Les intégrations complexes avec des systèmes CRM ou des workflows personnalisés peuvent prendre 1-2 semaines. On s'occupe de tout — vous n'avez qu'à valider la voix et le script.",
        "faq.q4": "Les appelants se rendent-ils compte qu'ils parlent à une IA ?",
        "faq.a4": "Nos voix sont construites avec une technologie de synthèse de pointe. La plupart des appelants ne réalisent pas qu'ils parlent à une IA. Nous privilégions un flux de conversation naturel, des pauses appropriées et une intonation humaine.",
        "faq.q5": "Quelles intégrations proposez-vous ?",
        "faq.a5": "Nous nous intégrons avec Google Calendar, Doctolib, HubSpot, Salesforce et la plupart des CRM/systèmes de réservation via API. Nous nous connectons aussi via Zapier, Make et n8n pour les workflows personnalisés.",
        "faq.q6": "Mes données sont-elles sécurisées ?",
        "faq.a6": "Absolument. Tous les appels sont chiffrés et nous respectons le RGPD. Les enregistrements sont stockés de manière sécurisée et peuvent être supprimés automatiquement selon votre politique de rétention. Nous ne vendons ni ne partageons jamais vos données.",
